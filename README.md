# CodePiece
Not architecture , Not framework ... They all have suitable scope ï¼Œredundancy  . CodePiece can make everything , you just pick one piece to use it building your framework ,widgets ,tools ..etc.

In a word ,Others like framework , library , make many single people together like a powerful team ,but  i want break it down to every single people , every has its own feature ,  if you need him ,pick it out and join in your team.

but Sorry ,i haven't think out the first step how to do...
